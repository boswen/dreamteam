# Dream Team

**A modular AI-powered creative studio designed to prototype and build passion projects through a team of virtual collaborators.**

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

Dream Team is an ambitious initiative to create a virtual development studio powered by AI agents—each one carefully "hired" and onboarded through hand-crafted system prompts that define their responsibilities, communication style, and personality.

The vision? A scalable team of autonomous, specialized agents who collaborate to bring creative dreams to life: from initial ideas, to prototypes, to full-scale games and media projects. Dream Team starts with a single concept: **Designing a prompt factory** capable of generating custom system prompts for any future role.

Eventually, this will serve as the foundation for a multi-agent studio environment where AI teammates:
- Brainstorm, design, and iterate on creative concepts.
- Build and refine prototypes collaboratively.
- Align their outputs to match the vision of creative leads and one another.
- Work toward completing real projects like mobile games, dev tools, or even Twitch/YouTube content.

## 🛠 Getting Started

We're still laying the foundation, so there's nothing to install or run just yet. But the vision is clear, and it's growing stronger with each new teammate we add - virtual or organic! ;)

## ✨ Future Ideas (To Be Explored)

- An interactive CLI or web UI for spinning up new AI teammates from prompt templates  
- Hosting agents locally via Ollama with roles tied to specific models or capabilities  
- Optional multiplayer mode where humans and AI collaborate together in real-time on game jams or narrative design sprints  
- Custom Dream Team SDK or plug-in for Unity/Unreal to allow AI teammates to directly assist within game engines
